Maybe next time.
Better luck next time.
You missed out.
Opportunity missed.
Another time, perhaps.
You'll get 'em next time.
That ship has sailed.
Tough luck.
Not this time.
Try again later.
Don't worry, there's plenty more fish in the sea.
Better to have loved and lost... or maybe not.
Next in line, please.
Missed your chance.
Close, but no cigar.
Keep fishing.
Just wasn't meant to be.
The stars didn't align this time.
Fate has other plans.
A near miss.
Life's full of surprises.
Chin up, there's always tomorrow.
